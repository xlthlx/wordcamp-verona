# Block Editor tricks for lazy people

```
So, you are using the Gutenberg editor now, and you love it, 
but It would never cross your mind to learn how to create your blocks, 
or you donâ€™t have a good relationship with React.
Did you know you can do a lot for less?

adding custom categories, redefining core blocks 
and putting to good use the theme.json.
